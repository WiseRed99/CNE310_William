New Python Code.

This code provides a way to look at a list in python charm and see if the word(s) exist in that list. If it meets a certain criteria (being true), than it will be printed. However, if it does not meet the criteria (being false), than it will be not printed and will continue on to the next object/string in the list.

## Getting Started

These instructions will run this code on your local machine for experimenting in the python charm app.

### Prerequisites

the Python code requires a PyCharm to run. The commands below will download a Python app.

PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#toolbox

## Running
Once installed you can run the program with the following command

```
python README(1).md.py
```

## Thanks
Thank you to Dr. Zak for providing the demos needed to do this homework, and for the PyCharm app to be able to run this code.
